# ArraySum2Numbers
Given an array of integers and a value, determine if there are any two integers in the array whose sum is equal to the given value. Return true if the sum exists and return false if it does not.

This is taken from a Google Challenge task.

I've commented the code so it should explain it line by line! :-)
